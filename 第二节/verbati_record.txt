So, we’ve been talking about the internet and how we use it to express ourselves, especially when traveling or experiencing new cultures. I’ve collected some examples —— some a bit older, but still relevant —— because you know, cewebrities are certain figures who have become especially famous during specific time periods.

One such figure is Jerry Kuo (Guo Jierui). He became particularly well-known during the COVID-19 pandemic. What made him stand out was his comparative commentary on pandemic responses between China and the U.S. Chinese audiences appreciated his honest critiques of how the U.S. handled the situation. He became a kind of cultural bridge —— an American who could speak candidly(adv. 率直地, 坦白地) about both countries.

Here’s another interesting case: a student from California, who graduated from Peking University’s Art Academy. She received the International Exchange Practitioner Award. Very impressive. As an undergraduate, she got four offers from top U.S. universities. But instead of accepting them, she said: ‘I want to explore a new world.’ So she came to China. After just one year here, she decided to stay.

I share this story to say: Think independently. Some students don't feel like going abroad. It's true that going abroad need money. But you can also learn while you earn, and explore without losing your roots. 

I’m not saying everyone should go abroad —— but if you do, don’t just go for the title. Go to truly understand a new culture. If you never try to see the world, you miss out on life itself. So I encourage you —— go out, try new things, and experience the world.

Now, let’s shift to something more creative.

Remember Luo Tianyi? She’s China’s first virtual singer —— and also the world’s first virtual idol, created by Shanghai Henian Information Technology. She was developed using Yamaha’s VOCALOID voice synthesis software. This was back in 2012, when nothing like this existed globally. So China was actually ahead of the curve(领先于潮流) in this space.

Luo Tianyi was designed as a 15-year-old girl —— a fixed character with green eyes, signature accessories(标志性的配饰), and a highly stylized anime look. She became a engine, driving the collaboration with brands like Prada, Xiaomi, and even Three Squirrels (a Chinese snack brand). Only in 2019, she generated 76 million RMB. Beyond that, she became a cultural symbol —— a representation of China’s digital soft power.

Interestingly, other countries started to follow. The U.S., for example, created a virtual influencer named Lil Miquela, a 19-year-old virtual girl created by a Los Angeles-based company. Miquela is different —— she looks almost human, not anime-style like Luo Tianyi. She has freckles, a gap tooth, and wears streetwear. She’s a fashion model, musician, and activist with over 3 million followers.

But here’s where it gets more interesting: Miquela doesn’t just sell products —— she speaks out on social issues. She advocates for racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and mental health awareness. These are real-world issues that many young people care about. In the U.S., these topics are part of everyday discourse(日常谈话). Miquela uses her platform to challenge norms(n. 标准, 规范；基准（norm复数形式）), saying things like: ‘I won’t be defined by society’s expectations of gender or identity.’

This is cultural difference —— something we didn’t see with Luo Tianyi. While Luo Tianyi sings and dances, Miquela reflects social realities. So, in terms of creative depth, some might argue the U.S. version has gone a step further —— using virtual influencers to mirror and shape societal values.

Now, let’s think critically.

Why did the American creators design Miquela as a mixed-race, Spanish-American girl?

Why three nationalities —— Spanish, Brazilian, and American?

Let’s discuss this in groups.

Some possible ideas:
- To represent multiple continents —— North America, South America, and Europe.
- To appeal to a global audience.
- To reflect the multicultural identity of modern America.

Also, during our discussion, if you come across a word you don't know, you can look it up immediately. Write it down in a book —— you need to learn to accumulate vocabulary. When you look up a word, you'll recognize it the next time you encounter it. So, don't completely avoid words you don't know. However, when you're expressing yourself in discussions, try to switch to different ways of expression. Don't get stuck on just one word. But after the discussion, you must look up those words —— that's how you expand your vocabulary. Only when you use the words will you truly understand them and learn them effectively. So, I think you can prepare a notebook specifically for recording the words you don't know during class discussions this semester. Right? And don't just leave them in the notebook and forget about them. Before class, spend 5 minutes reviewing the words you learned in the last class. You need to learn vocabulary in such a detailed way. Once you accumulate enough, your expressive ability will improve.
 
OK, now please.

Demonstrate the uniqueness, the inclusiveness, and the diversity. Also, promote international exchanges and draw more people's attention. These are the three aspects, right?

Three aspects, right? What was the first aspect? Four words were used, right? Uniqueness, and what else? 

Um, uniqueness (uniqueness). The United States also emphasizes individuality. So I think words like openness, inclusiveness, and uniqueness are what he wanted to use.

To attract people's attention through nationality. And there’s the cultural aspect. Promoting cultural communication. 

Very good —— you set a great example. Her points are clear, and the words she used are very appropriate. That’s excellent, right?
 
So what abilities do we hope everyone will practice in the future? First, the ability to organize ideas. You must think of the key words. The discussion result of that group just now was very good. On the other hand, you need to learn to catch others’ ideas and not forget them. 

Is there anyone from other groups? No need for long speeches —— just catch the key words. Alright, these two groups have shared their ideas. What about your group? You two, and your group —— do you have any new points? It seems we’ve covered most of them.

I told you at the beginning of the semester —— what ability do we need to develop? Creativity. I don’t want you to repeat others; you need to have this mindset. When others are about to say something, you should come up with new ideas. Since we’re just starting to practice, you need to learn to develop new ideas and different ideas now —— no repetition. That way, others can have a deeper impression of you. 

For example, when you start working, if you only say what the leader already said, they won’t pay much attention because there are few new ideas. Right? But if you put forward new points every time, you’ll get noticed more quickly, and thus have more chances to be valued. 

So, do you have any new ideas? Have you discussed? The time was quite short just now. What about the girls? Let’s discuss. Since the time was short, we’ll give everyone this opportunity at the beginning —— don’t underestimate the power of group cooperation. Everyone has many ideas; you need to let them speak out and learn to summarize them. Stand in front and speak boldly with courage —— these are the things we need to do. 

Today, the girls were very brave; even though they might have been a bit nervous, you could tell they’re bold kids, right? I believe after 3 more practice sessions, you’ll definitely change. You’ll take the initiative to say, "Teacher, I want to stand in front and speak —— I don’t want to stay silent." So now, we need to practice this ability and push ourselves. You’re welcome —— even if you stand here and say nothing, we’ll acknowledge your courage. OK, if you don’t have new ideas, let’s pause here and look at the summary I prepared for everyone. It might not be comprehensive, but it can help you develop new thinking directions.

For example, using cultural appeal to make people pay more attention to the virtual idol —— if she has more fans, what’s the purpose of this point? 

It’s market appeal. Commercial strategy —— everyone knows that one of the main purposes of creating such a virtual idol is economic interest, right? To attract more companies to use this icon and earn huge profits —— this is an important point. In other words, using her image to achieve market goals. It’s similar to Luo Tianyi —— you know, Luo Tianyi earned 760,000 yuan a year. It’s said that this virtual idol (we’re talking about) earns 7,000 dollars (if I remember correctly) —— that’s a lot. Many companies want to use her system. If you use her image, you have to pay, right? Otherwise, it’s copyright infringement(侵权).  So this virtual idol earns much more than many Chinese people. 

So these are two key points: cultural appeal and economic appeal. We can consider from these angles. 

Alright, let’s briefly analyze these internet celebrities —— they’re virtual. When we discuss internet celebrities in the future, we need to note two aspects: real ones and virtual ones. OK, so we’ll have more questions later, and you need to think from multiple perspectives. That’s the way.
 
Have we done the listening exercise? No? OK, now open your books to page 51. We are going to learn Unit 4 "Meeting New People" —— is that the right one? Oh, point 4, page 4.

……(听力练习部分略)
 
Now, let's move on to the next question. We won't talk too much about this one because it's quite simple. Let's discuss another question: What impacts have Chinese internet celebrities had on China? We will focus on China and talk about the influence of Chinese internet celebrities on Chinese society —— any aspects are fine. What impacts have Chinese internet celebrities had on China? You can discuss several aspects with your partners. I didn't guide you through this before, but now you should have some experience. Discuss with your partners. OK.
 
"Chinese celebrities have on China" —— this requires structured thinking.
 
If you just talk about "impacts" without direction, it's hard to come up with ideas. So how should you think about it? You need a framework to organize your thoughts so that you can express your ideas clearly. 

Did I tell you all that our class will show short videos? Maybe you all forgot. If I didn't mention it before, let's start from next week —— each week, a group will show a short video to the class. The videos can be about anything: singing, dancing, games, talk shows, speeches —— anything relaxing and enjoyable, as long as it's related to English. The purpose is to help everyone learn more about the world outside. Who is the leader of Group 1? Please raise your hand. Have we divided into groups yet?
 
For now, let's ask a student from Group 1 to lead the group in finding a video. We used to do this in class, and students enjoyed it. You can show anything you like. Have we found the students in Group 1 yet? Let's ask this student to act as the temporary leader. If the original leader doesn't come, we'll proceed with this arrangement for now. Find a video, and from now on, the class monitor should remind each group every week. Group 2, you can prepare a video that's about 5 minutes long —— don't make it too long. Also, have you all filled out the small questionnaire I sent in the group chat?
 
Those who haven't filled it out, please do it now. You can see how the questionnaire is designed —— this will help you when we do research in the future. You need to learn how to design and conduct questionnaire surveys, because this is currently the only way we can collect data. Just scan the QR code to fill it out. The questionnaire is about Chinese intangible cultural heritage. Everyone can scan the code and fill it out now. Let's take a few minutes to do this, since we need to collect the data. I'll give you 3 minutes. During this time, you can also think about the previous question (impacts of Chinese internet celebrities), and we'll discuss it later. OK? Those who haven't filling out the questionnaire, please finish it first. Then we can discuss the question and ask some groups to present their ideas. 

We can do a roll call after class to record who spoke actively. At the end of the semester, I will count who spoke the most and give extra points to their usual grades. We will start counting from now on, but participation is voluntary —— I won't force anyone to speak. OK. I'll give you at most 3 more minutes.
