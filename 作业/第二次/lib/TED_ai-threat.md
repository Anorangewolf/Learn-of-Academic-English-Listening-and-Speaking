# The Rise of the AI Need to be Controled by Humanity

## The rise of the AI and the robots is scary

- Lead in by a question: "Who here is fear of killer robots?"

- Many movies Many movies have scenes of AI ending humanity

- Elon Mask

- Compare to robots, AI is much more powerful and dangerous

## Can AI be trusted?

- Many people trust AI given information as they are real
    - This is doubtful

### Example: Wolf Picture

- AI pay attention to snow in the background.

- AI algorithm connected the presence of snow to the presence of wolf.

- Researchers have no idea of the conditions "inside the box", if they don't discover it mannually.

#### Conclusion

AI decision have biases

### Example: AI system is used in 13 states in America to help judge crimes

- AI think that African have higher crime rate than white people.(Bias)

- We use AI for effeciency, but it can lead to biases. And people have no idea of this(People don't know wether ai is right or not).

## We can not stop the developement of AI

- AI is now used in many fields in our real life, but it still have biases.
- People have nothing to do about those biases, so we need to have regulations.
- AI is to young technology to have a complete regulation system, but is using now.

### Example: The experiment in authority

- The experiment can't stop, though there were people who hurt by the experiment.
- This is same to AI developement.

## Humanity must decide how far do we want to go in the AI development

### Example: The car trip around America

- The developemeny of AI is like driving in the rain, which soon will turn to snow

- AI will change the humanity society much bigger and deeper than industrial revolution.
    - AI will replace jobs now do by human. Is AI can be fully trusted doing these jobs itself?
    - We need to have regulations to protect humanity.
    - We need to lead AI, not let it be controlled by machines.

## Conclusion

Work together with ai, we may be able to solve some of our greatest challenges. But to do that, human must lead AI. The only thing we need to fear is ourselves.
