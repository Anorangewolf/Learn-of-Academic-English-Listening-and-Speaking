# The Hidden Dangers and Ethical Implications Under the Rise of AI Systems Need to be Controlled by Humanity

## The rise of the AI and the robots is scary?

- Lead in by a question: "Who here is fear of killer robots?"

- Many movies Many movies have scenes of AI ending humanity

- Elon Musk

- Compare to robots, AI is much more powerful and dangerous

## Can AI be trusted?

- Many people trust AI given information as they are real
    - This is doubtful

### Example: Wolf Picture

- AI pay attention to snow in the background.

- AI algorithm connected the presence of snow to the presence of wolf.

- Researchers have no idea of the conditions "inside the box", if they don't discover it manually.

#### Conclusion

AI decisions have biases

### COMPAS algorithm used in 13 states

- COMPAS is more likely to flag African Americans as violent offenders
- We use AI for effeciency, but judges cannot inspect the source code

## We can not stop the development of AI

- AI is now used in multiple critical areas in our real life, but it still have biases.
- No transparency in decision-making process, people have nothing to do about this, so we need to have regulations.
- AI is too young a technology to have a complete regulation system, but is being used now.

### Example: Milgram's authority experiment

- People follow authority even when harming others
- AI becomes the ultimate authority figure
- No reflection or change in AI decisions

## Humanity must decide how far do we want to go in the AI development

### Example: The car trip around America

- AI development is like driving in rain that will soon turns to snow:
    - Starts small but can become dangerous quickly
    - Economic incentives will drive rapid AI adoption.

- AI will change the humanity society much bigger and deeper than industrial revolution.
    - AI will replace jobs now do by human. Can AI be fully trusted doing these jobs by itself?
    - We need to have regulations and standards early to protect humanity.
    - We need to lead AI, not let ourselves controlled by machines.

## Conclusion

Work together with ai, we may be able to solve some of our greatest challenges. But to do that, **human must lead AI**. The only thing we need to fear is ourselves.
