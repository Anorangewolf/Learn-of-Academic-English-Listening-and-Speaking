- Datafication: Turning behaviors into data (location, posture, etc.)

#### Applications of Big Data

- Machine learning revolution:
   1. Computers learning from data (checkers example)
   2. Enables self-driving cars, medical diagnoses
- Real-world implementations:
   1. Anti-theft car systems

- Job displacement:
   1. Threat to professional knowledge work
   2. Historical comparison to Industrial Revolution

#### Conclusion

- Big data will transform society fundamentally
- Need to focus on information (not just technology)
- Humanity must master this tool carefully
