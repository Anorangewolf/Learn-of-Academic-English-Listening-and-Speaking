Cons:

- Content:
- Presence:
    - Weak Posture
        - It looks like he's kind of nervous at first.(Always put his hands in pockets, doesn't stand tall at first)
    - Doesn't give the audiences enough respect
        - He doesn't greet the audiences nor does he thank them for listening to his talk.
    - In a few seconds when express his ideas, he talked to fast. Actually, he paused, giving audience time to think and understand, but I think the pause is too short and the pace is too fast.
