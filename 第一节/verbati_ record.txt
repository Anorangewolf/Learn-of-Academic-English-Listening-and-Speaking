Now, firstly, I'll introduce the class. I think most students have had the class of Academic English for Reading and Writing in the last semester, right? And in this semester, we will focus on Speaking and Listening. Yeah. Although maybe in the past we have trained these abilities, in this class, we will try our best to train these two kinds of abilities. It does not mean that we will ignore reading, because all these skills are closely related to each other.

In today's class, I will firstly introduce myself. Some students may know my name. My name is Li Xuxin. “学” means study, “欣” means happy. The meaning of my name is that I always regard study as happiness. Just like that. My English name is Catherine. This is my email, and we also have other ways to communicate with each other, right?

OK, now let's move on. I have been teaching this Academic English course for nearly 8 years, OK, almost 8 years. We started this course in 2017. At first, it was focused on Reading and Writing, and now we will try to make some adjustments. But I don't like to use only one method for learning.

Now, this part is the introduction of today's task. I will give an introduction to the course purposes, textbooks, reference materials, the content (which means what we will learn), homework, schedule (or the time arrangement), and maybe the course content. Uh, next, I'll also talk about how I get to the school.

OK, now let's look at the learning objectives. You know, this is an English class, and I think you are familiar with English classes. Maybe some students have been learning English for more than 10 years. But our class is different from your previous English learning, because it is more oriented towards science and engineering students. Yeah, I think most of you are from science and engineering majors.

What does "academic" mean? It means doing research. And what is research? Research means solving problems, not just learning knowledge. So Academic English is not about just learning knowledge, but about using English to solve problems—whether they are real-life problems or theoretical ones, to help us understand concepts, theories, or solve real-life issues. That is the academic meaning of trying to solve various problems.

Now, in this semester, we focus on oral abilities, which include listening and speaking. Besides language ability, we also need to train thinking ability—how your brain works. I think thinking ability is the most important, not only in expression but also in research. In this academic course, we mainly focus on three key abilities. The second one is language ability, which includes listening and speaking. The next one is presentation ability, which is different from last semester.

What did we do last semester? We taught you a lot of academic knowledge, and we used textbooks—you all have the books, right? In this class, we will focus on how to speak and how to listen. But this listening and speaking is not just about common English; the content is more difficult than what you have listened to before, even harder than CET-4 and CET-6, and almost at the level of TOEFL or IELTS. You will find that the textbook is compiled by our school. At first, you may find it difficult, especially the lecture parts. But as time goes by, you will gradually learn how to understand them.

Understanding the content includes listening for the general idea. You should listen to the main idea. These skills may be something you haven't formally learned, but you have been using them. How to listen for the general idea? It means trying to understand some specific information and then form a whole picture in your mind. That is, you first listen to some words, then organize them in your mind to get the main idea.

The second one is listening for specific information. I will give you tips later. It's not about listening to the whole content, but about specific details like time and location. How should we pay attention to these?

The third one is detecting signals. Here, "signals" mean finding some key linguistic clues—some vocabulary that is like a "road sign" for us. These words can help you predict what will come next. For example, when you hear "first of all", "second", "third", you may understand that the speaker is trying to list items. OK? When you hear "move on to", you may understand that this part is different from the previous one, and the speaker may change the topic. So you should try to listen carefully and pay more attention to these signals. So this is the third main ability.

Next one is inferring. Inferring means trying to predict the hidden meaning, even though the speaker didn't mention it directly. It means that based on the words you have heard, you try to draw a conclusion—but this conclusion is your own understanding, not the facts or information the speaker directly told you. That's what we call inferring.

In fact, we have used a simple method for inferring before. For example, if you can infer something from what you hear, you just choose all the information you heard, and that would be the answer. We often did that before. But in real life, no one will give you ready-made problems; you have to judge based on the information you get.

OK, next one is note-taking. Note-taking is very important in advanced learning. Because in the past, the listening materials were short, so it was easy for you to remember and organize the information. But as you listen to more difficult information, you should try to take notes. What do we need to learn now? We must learn to take notes—write down some words while listening. Don't rely on your memory to remember everything, because the content is long, and you may not even understand the previous part before the next part starts. So taking notes is a skill we will strengthen this semester; we call it "note-taking shorthand". You see, all advanced interpreters use this skill. Understanding and then writing down notes will help you organize information later. So these are the listening and speaking skills we will develop this semester, and they are the focus of this semester.

I think some students are familiar with presentations, but this is not the same as the common speeches we did before. What is it then? It's academic presentation, which is based on your writing. It's not about talking about a simple topic; you need to report your research and its findings to the audience or your partners. You should first do some experiments, then present your new research findings to the public. So we can say this is a combination of reading, speaking, and listening. It's like an enhanced version of what we did last semester.

What does "enhanced" mean? Before, some students would memorize the content for two days and then give the presentation. Because our focus was on writing last semester. But now it's different————we will specifically train everyone in this aspect. So we will start from how to plan and prepare a presentation.

What was your preparation like before? Maybe you copied two paragraphs from DeepSeek, or copied a few sentences from Chinese materials, translated them, and then finished it. But actually, that's not a real presentation. Some foreign students often say that Chinese students always copy. Generally speaking—not every student—but some students do like to copy others' work. Foreigners consider this shameful, and we should also take this as a warning. Instead, we should use AI tools to find the information we need, then express it in our own way based on our own understanding.

Moreover, we need to consider the audience—who you will be giving the presentation to. If you are speaking to primary school students, who know nothing about the topic, your academic presentation should be simpler. If you are speaking to your classmates, who have stronger comprehension but don't understand your field, you need to explain more professional terms but don't need to go into too much detailed knowledge. But if you are speaking to your professional teachers, who know much more than you, you can omit the explanation of terms.

So for different audiences, you should make different preparations and use different presentation skills. We will consider these important details later. In the future, if you participate in international conferences, or if you pursue a PhD, then work in a research institute or a university, you will take this path of academic research—and you will use these presentation skills a lot. You will need to report your research to experts or foreign friends.

Even if you don't do research, academic presentation skills are still useful. For example, if you work in a company, your team may conduct in-depth research, and you need to write a report and present to your leaders, explaining the characteristics of your product. It's the same principle. So if you train well this semester and put in enough effort, it will be much easier for you to handle future research work. I hope everyone will really invest in this course. That's the first point.

To try, maybe, design your structure. The first aspect is language, right? Then comes methodology. Actually, when organizing content, we need to clarify what to say first and what to say later. Your order must not be chaotic; if the order is messed up or the arrangement between paragraphs lacks logic, the audience won't understand. So the basis for all we do is "make yourself understood by the audience"—let the audience understand and be willing to communicate with you. To achieve this, we must design the structure well, and at the same time, we need to know "What are the good features of a good presentation".

Later, we will introduce some TED talks to you, which is equivalent to guiding you to "appreciate" them and see what makes these talks excellent. In the future, we will also have such an assessment: you will analyze other students' presentations, point out their strengths and weaknesses, and the teacher will grade this task specifically to assess your ability. If you can analyze well, it shows that your level is definitely high. We must not only use superficial standard like "clear logic, distinct hierarchy, and accurate wording", besides you need to identify the substantive highlights. 

This semester, each of you will give an academic presentation on stage. At that time, we will select a group of well-executed presentations, analyze their advantages in detail, and provide you with a reference template so that you know what a good presentation is and what problems need to be avoided. Only by learning in this way can you gain real progress, so our academic presentations must be carefully polished. 

Thirdly, many students now make PPTs, but some do it very well while others do it badly————filling the entire screen with text will make the audience feel dizzy and unable to focus on your speech at all. Therefore, later we will specifically talk about what a good PowerPoint should be like, and we will also analyze it with cases of some previously recognized excellent speakers. 

Next is the specific manner of presentation; for example, you can tell a story at the beginning, which is completely acceptable, or ask a question at the beginning and let everyone raise their hands to interact. So we will try to maybe give you an introduction to this and help you to understand how you should give the presentation in an efficient way.
 
Another top priority is the ability to give academic presentations, which is targeted at "academia" rather than ordinary presentations. 

Developing thinking ability is also important. Thinking, I think, is maybe the most important————not only our listening and speaking abilities, but also writing is inseparable from thinking ability. Thinking is all, maybe the conductor, is the leader. Now, if you have very good thinking ability, you shouldn't—you couldn't speak not well. So here, as for thinking ability, usually we have three kinds of ways of thinking. Students, do you know these three types of thinking? It doesn't matter if you don't. For example, can you explain what logical thinking means?
 
Student: Well... I think it means your thinking has a clear order, hahaha, that's my understanding.
 
Thinking logical, right? It is particularly important that when you explain a concept, you can only prove that you truly understand it if you can express it in words. We often say "this person has poor independent thinking ability".

Could you say something? ... 

Has about half of the class attended my class this morning? OK, my old students all know that I often say "if you can't express it, just say 'sorry'", and you don't need to feel shy, because it's normal if you don't know; if you already knew everything, what's the point of learning? But you need to note that even if you only know a little, even just a keyword, you should say it. I strongly encourage everyone to be brave enough to express themselves, and we don't care whether what you say is correct or good————what matters is that you have the courage to speak. Even if what you say is incorrect, being able to speak in an organized and persuasive way is still a progress; the key is to "speak out". 

OK. What does the word "reasonable" mean? In fact, it means explaining things thoroughly—if you explain a concept without understanding it yourself and lead everyone into another concept that they don't understand, that's not "explanation". So the core of logical thinking is "being reasonable". This sounds a bit difficult, right? 

Student: From reason to result, to be understandable for other people. 

Hmm, quite right. Classmate, now you can talk about one aspect of logical thinking. Usually, your expression can reflect "reason" and "respect", right? Very good, or it can also reflect "result"————your speech should allow everyone to clearly see the connection between "reason" and "result". Do you think there are other aspects?
 
Student: The core of logical thinking is having a clear causal relationship, allowing everyone to understand the causal connection. 

What else? Yeah, I think you're right. I think everybody now understands. If your logical thinking is strong, others can understand your expression.
 
Student: How we go home? Yeah, how can I go home in a very new way? And we have so many special shoes, and we all choose one, like basketball shoes...
 
You know how to go home, OK? Which way you can choose, right? He used a metaphor to explain. So what is logical thinking? It's equivalent to "which route I should choose to go home, which road to take first and which one later"—this kind of explanation is more in line with the essence. So when it comes to logical thinking, the first point I mentioned just now, I think the most important word is "relationship", which means you can clearly express the relationships between things, establish clear connections, and prevent others from feeling that the relationships are confusing. For example, if I come to class and start talking about an example of a certain county, then jump to a theory, and then talk about other things, that's confusing, right? The correct approach is to follow the order you designed: say which first and which later. After you finish speaking, the audience can clearly see the causal relationship in it. The "way home" he mentioned just now is to explain the expression method of logical thinking, aiming to help everyone understand "how to establish the relationships between things". So students need to sort out the relationships between things—are they causal relationships, sequential relationships, or hierarchical relationships (like upper and lower, left and right). First of all, the audience must be able to see these relationships, and the order must be well-arranged. There must be a basis for determining which comes first and which comes later, such as from inside to outside, from top to bottom. All expressions must be based on a certain design and have clear standards; the core is "sorting out the relationships between things". 

In fact, all of you have quite good logical thinking abilities, but you haven't consciously realized that you need to apply them in expression. Last year in a class, we've held a small debate among students. We found that some students couldn't connect their words when responding to others' statements, and the questions they raised didn't focus on the key points; some students just pieced together sentences from books when answering questions, without a clear logical line. So we say that thinking with logic means making your expression have "a rail" that allows the audience to follow your train of thought. In the future, everyone must remember to think before expressing: what to say first and what to say later? Should I start from the outside to the inside, or from the inside to the outside? Should I talk about phenomena first and then explore the essence, or talk about the essence first and then give examples of phenomena? In short, arrange your expression in the way that helps everyone understand————that is logical thinking. So starting from this semester, we need to actively apply logical thinking in expression.
 
Now, creative thinking is what，you think? What is the key?
 
Student: I think it's a kind of ability to explore new things.
 
Student: And have the ability to make your ideas come true. 

OK, basically when we talk about "creative", we say first one is new, right? Secondly, different.
 
What does "new" mean? It refers to things or ideas that have never appeared before. There was a phenomenon among us before: when some people had nothing to say while answering questions, they would say "I agree with him" or "I agree with her"————this is called lack of creativity. Why? Because you always follow others, right? This will make you seem unskilled; you need to say something different from others. So from now on, I hope everyone will try to express in a different way when speaking, whether it's your viewpoints or the way of expression, you should have some freshness. This classmate just now used a metaphor, which I think is very creative————using a way that others don't use, or a way with new ideas, that is creativity. 

This also applies to our research: imitation is the foundation, but on the basis of imitation, you need to make some improvements, and that is real research; if you only do simple imitation, it's not real research. OK, so now we need to require ourselves to do something different both in expression and thinking. In the future, when I ask everyone to speak, please don't say "I agree with him" or "I agree with you" anymore; you should say "I have something different from the others"————this is the smart way to do it, right?

OK, now, next one. What do you call this kind of thinking? 

Student: Critical thinking. May I mean challenge the association? 

Challenge. Anything else? I think that's great. Hmm, you're right. Very good. Now, partner, desk mate, please. 

Student: I think critical thinking means we should look at things from different perspectives, such as light and dark.
 
White and black, OK, which is equivalent to the common saying "Every coin has two sides". Can not just look at the bright side; it has the dark side. OK, oh, I think great. We have two students who got it right.
 
Among the three types of thinking we need to develop, it seems that the most difficult one is the last one—critical thinking. Because some students don't understand it very well; they only know that "we need to challenge", but in fact, what should we challenge? It is to question a principle or a viewpoint, but this kind of questioning is based on fully acknowledging its correctness, and then try to find some limitation. 

Here, critical thinking means that we have several points to follow, and I will tell you more about them. 

First of all, to consider another perspective. We should understand this "another" as "different perspectives" or "all possible perspectives". When considering a problem, a thing is not necessarily either black or white ————Chinese people often easily fall into the misunderstanding of "either black or white", but in fact, there is a "gray area" in many cases. 

Now, the academic community has begun to rename "critical thinking" as "evaluative thinking", because when we say "critical thinking", it is easy for people to associate it with "criticize" and think that it means denying something, which is actually wrong. It doesn't mean "this thing must be wrong", but to understand things with an analytical perspective. Just like "the blind men and the elephant": 

Seven blind men touched an elephant from seven different angles and got seven different conclusions, but only when these conclusions are combined can we get the real appearance of the elephant————even seven angles are not enough, maybe ten or more angles are needed. 

We live in an era where perspectives will increase more and more with development. So now we need to know that there are many different angles to analyze, understand, and observe a thing. If you are limited to only one angle, you can't see the whole picture; even if you are limited to two or three angles, it's not comprehensive enough. If you can look at a thing from seven angles, that person is extremely excellent, but few people can do that. That many patients with depression are often due to having too few angles to look at problems and being limited; if you consider more angles, you won't fall into narrow limitations. Therefore, our critical thinking is to let everyone think about something from multiple perspectives.

OK, then the next one is the "questioning" that the students mentioned just now. What to question? Question the existing validity, correctness, and its limitations. Moreover, you need to state your theoretical basis. 

What is the purpose of questioning? It's not "questioning for the sake of questioning", but to analyze this thing more comprehensively. In the future, I also hope that everyone will question me and question the shortcomings of our textbooks, but questioning is not "complaining", "venting anger", or "releasing resentment"————it's not like that. 

Instead, it's to make everyone realize "oh, there are still unexplored points in this area", and there's no need to severely criticize it, right? So questioning is not criticizing. 

The third point is to identify bias. Well... Do you know China is becoming more and more powerful now? Whether it's enterprises engaged in electronic technology like Huawei or our theoretical circles, they all emphasize "independence", which means we need to establish China's own theoretical system. Because in the past, especially when we learned English and Western theories (such as the linguistic theories mentioned by Lu Xun), they were all from Western perspectives. Later, we found that their ideas are different from ours. The West has "Western-centrism", as if they are the center of the world and their theories are the only correct perspective. But if we look at problems from the perspective of "Orientalism", the conclusion is completely different—so this shows that Western theories have biases. Now we need to know that when you conduct research and use a certain theory, you should be clear that this theory is only limited to specific angles and specific conditions. If you change the scenario or the group, this theory may no longer be valid. So you need to find out where its bias lies————this is what a critical thinker should do————not only discover limitations on the basis of acknowledging correctness, but also realize the possible biases of the theory itself. 

The fourth point, and a more important one, is that few people will consider this in our evaluative thinking: we need to learn to weigh your evidence. What does "evidence" mean? Something to support your argument, based on your evidence. People engaged in academic research attach great importance to this point. The same applies to those in the legal field————where is the evidence? You can't just say "I feel very cold today," but that's just your personal feeling. Whether it is really cold today depends on what? We rely on the temperature————what's the specific degree? Personal feelings don't count, the key lies in objective information about the world.
 
For example if you say "this lecture is really bad," you need to be aware that this is also just your personal perspective. You can't draw a conclusion without providing any evidence. To reach a conclusion, if you claim the teacher's lecture is poor, you should specify in which aspects? For example, unclear speech, slow speaking speed, or lack of interaction with students—these are all pieces of evidence you can use. However, even with such evidence, before drawing the conclusion, you must weigh the evidence carefully. You first need to collect all the evidence, then eliminate the false and retain the true, and select the evidence that best supports your viewpoint and is logically sound. Only then can you raise doubts and make criticisms.
 
Therefore, presenting and showing evidence is extremely important. In all future endeavors and statements, the academic mindset is reflected in "providing evidence," and critical thinking is also embodied in "providing evidence." This point is also crucial in our studies. For instance, if a student wants to ask for leave in the future and says "Teacher, I'm sick," that's just your statement, right? How to prove that you are "really sick"? The teacher will need a diagnosis certificate issued by a doctor. With this certificate, the evidence is sufficient. So we must always remember to provide evidence, especially in the legal field, where this is even more emphasized.
 
Looking back on our past English learning, the main focus was on cultivating the ability to express ourselves correctly and logically. That is the basis, the basic level of English learning. You should try to evaluate your own ability—to express yourself logically, creatively, and critically. Take the previous CET-4 and CET-6 exams as an example: they attached great importance to clear, accurate, and fluent expression. As long as you didn't speak in a rambling or hesitant way and made no mistakes, that was acceptable.
 
But now, the requirements for us have become higher. What are these higher requirements? Every student must pay attention to expressing themselves logically, demonstrating the connections between things, and clarifying their relationships. Additionally, your expression should be different from others', it needs to have new ideas. At the same time, you must also support your words with evidence. Moreover, you should approach expression from multiple perspectives and learn to question others' viewpoints and methods. If you can achieve all this, your expressive ability will represent a more advanced level that we pursue in English learning. Do you all understand? So this requires us to climb the stairs, improving step by step to a higher level. In the future, we will hold everyone to this standard, and you should also set such requirements for yourselves.
 
Alright, let's move on to the next part. Let's look at the passage. I think most of you should have the textbook, right? That's good. If you don't have it yet, try to buy one. We will set up a WeChat group during the break later, and some information will be shared in the group, including a link to a book-purchasing platform where you can buy the textbook at a lower price.
 
Let's talk about the textbook. We used the old version before, and now we will continue to learn it. All these textbooks are compiled by our School of Foreign Languages. Ours is a public course, and we mainly focus on the spoken English part. Besides the text content, I will also supplement some other materials. For example, I will find some speeches related to emerging themes from external sources, as well as content from English online open courses. When we study these materials, we won't just focus on how engaging or vivid the speeches are; more importantly, we will examine whether the evidence presented by the speakers is sufficient.By the way, there are also some reference books, which may be slightly outdated in version. If you are interested, you can buy them on your own.
 
Alright, let's move to the next question. What will we learn in this textbook? The textbook contains 8 units, but we will only cover 6 of them. Among these, Units 1 to 4 are compulsory or mandatory courses for the entire academic year, and all students of all grades must study them. For the remaining Units 5 to 8, the teacher will make a selective choice. I have chosen Unit 6 and Unit 7, with themes "Aerospace" and "Environment" respectively. These two fields are relatively cutting-edge, so we will spend more time explaining them. We will teach these 6 units in the order they appear in the textbook.
 
Next, let's talk about the learning methods. 

Regarding the methods of attending classes and learning, one point is very important: no matter how wonderful the teacher's lecture is, if you don't pay attention yourself, you will still fail to understand or follow. 

Alternatively, even if we conduct training for a month, the effect will be poor if you don't review and consolidate what you've learned after class. So what is the most important thing here? The teacher will teach you methods, but you must take the initiative to practice on your own after class. 

Next let's talk about our final exam.

Let's look at the total scores. Five questions are from the textbook, with 2 points each, totaling 10 points. Adding 15-point summary writing and another 5-point question type, the total is 30 points. All these 30 points come from the textbook. If you review well for the final exam, it will be easy to get these points.

For these 30-point questions, it won't be a big problem even if you lose a few points at most, right? You can easily get 20 plus 10 points, which adds up to 30 points. Isn't that true?

Then, if you think about it, it's still relatively easy to get another 30 points from the remaining questions. In this way, you can basically master 50 points without much effort. For the remaining 10 points, you can even get some by guessing.

So, everyone doesn't need to be too nervous about the final exam. What the teacher values more is improving everyone's listening ability, that is, academic ability.

Next, there are some key points to emphasize. First, students who don't have the textbook need to buy one, OK? I suggest that if you are not in a tight financial situation, you should try to buy a new textbook. Why? Because there are clear answers written in used textbooks. If you use a used textbook in class, it will be difficult to achieve the training effect.

If you already have a used textbook, you can erase the answers on it tomorrow. In short, do not use used textbooks that have been done by others. Even if you get all the answers right with such textbooks, you cannot truly improve your ability. 

Second, we need to select a class representative. The relevant requirements are the same as before, and I will repeat them to everyone.First, let's talk about the benefits of being a class representative. As everyone knows, the class representative will definitely get the highest regular grade because they are responsible for some class work. Besides, you don't have to worry that being a class representative will be very tiring. In fact, it's not that tiring. The main work is to forward notifications online to everyone as soon as possible and urge classmates. That's basically it. There are no particularly complicated tasks. We have two main requirements for the class representative: first, being responsible; second, being responsive. What does "being responsive" mean? It means that you should forward the messages sent by the teacher immediately after seeing them. Because if you don't forward them in time, you may forget about them in two days. I'm the same way — when I receive notifications from superiors, I will forward them to students within one minute. If you really forget to check WeChat and fail to forward the notifications, it will affect everyone's study. For example, a previous class representative forgot to forward a long article I sent. I originally required everyone to read it in advance for in-class discussion, but in the end, no one had read it. We had to spend time reading it in class, which greatly delayed the progress. Therefore, the class representative must be serious, responsible and responsive. Third, the class representative should have the ability to handle problems flexibly and independently. Don't ask the teacher about everything; you should have your own judgment and confidence. In addition, you can discuss with classmates when encountering problems. For example, you can directly send notifications in the group; if a classmate sends you a reasonable suggestion via private message, you can adjust accordingly, right? So, the class representative doesn't necessarily have to have the best English grades. As long as they can do the work well, that's enough. These are our requirements.

Our principle for selecting the class representative is volunteer (Volunteer). If you want to be the class representative, you can sign up at any time.If there are many applicants, we will select through a PK, just like before. What do you need to talk about during the PK? You can talk about your hobbies, which college and major you are from, and you can also talk about "If you are chosen to be the representative, what will you do?" Just make these clear. The rest depends on the students' votes. Whoever everyone votes for will be the class representative, and the teacher will not interfere. If there are few applicants, only one person, then that person will be the class representative; if no one signs up, the teacher may designate someone. However, I don't think we need to worry about no one signing up this semester. I know many students, and I will also invite everyone to be the class representative later. Alright, if anyone wants to be the class representative today, you can come to me after class; if you haven't made up your mind now but have the idea at night, you can also contact me directly via WeChat.

Next, let's briefly talk about the exemption from the course. The application for course exemption will close on the 26th. Today is the 25th, so it will close tomorrow. If any student wants to apply for exemption, you need to fill out a form online and upload your grades. Some students meet the exemption requirements, but you still need to weigh the pros and cons and pay attention to the risks involved. Some students also asked, "Teacher, I want to apply for exemption and my grades are sufficient, but I still want to attend English classes." Such students are really good. Can they attend the classes? Of course, they are welcome. You need to think clearly: after being exempted, you will not get credits for attending the classes. Are you sure you will still have the motivation to study? However, I believe that such students will definitely study seriously.

Uh, that's all for the reminder about course exemption. Alright, let's move on to the next content.

This semester, there may be a "National College Students' 5-Minute Academic English Speech Contest". This contest may be in the winter group or the summer group; it mainly depends on the arrangement of the organizing committee. This is a national-level contest, and all participants are peers. Generally speaking, most of the universities participating in the academic English speech contest are science and engineering universities, but our school has achieved very good results in previous contests — there are more than a dozen students who won the first prize, and many who won the second and third prizes. Therefore, if you want to gain advantages for applying for "Merit Student", class cadre or scholarships, you can participate in more such contests. At that time, the teacher will send the contest notice to everyone. If you are interested, you can prepare your speech and participate. A student in our class win a prize last year. I think it was the first prize at the school level. He was really excellent. But unfortunately, he couldn't attend the final due to health reasons. So, I suggest that if you are interested in this contest, you must prepare actively.

Alright, next one — regarding the class introduction. Next, let's turn to our textbook (Next let's turn to our textbook). Since some students may not have the textbook yet, we won't talk much about the textbook content today, but just give a brief introduction and overview.

The theme of this unit is about computers and the Internet (in this unit is about the computer and internet). As everyone knows, computers and the Internet are not new topics; they have existed for a long time (you know computer and internet is not the new topic, it's very old), but the related technologies have developed very, very quickly recently, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robots (robot). They are developing rapidly now and may integrate into our lives soon (maybe have entered our life).

So maybe we will talk much about that.

The theme we are looking at today is "cewebrity". What does it mean? There is a "Web" in the middle, so it's "Web celebrity". 

Do you know the word "Celebrate"? "Celebrate" is a verb, which means "to celebrate", right?Isn't that true? For example, "Let's celebrate the national holiday". But "celebrity" here is a noun, which means "a famous person". And "Web celebrities" here refer to "online influencers", that is, famous people on the Internet. Besides this, there are other words that mean "online influencers", such as "web influencer".

Yeah, "influence" is a verb, and "influencer" is a noun, referring to someone who can influence others . There is also "social media star". "Star" originally refers to a shining star, and it is usually used to describe someone who can influence others. People will follow them, just like what is shown in the picture. Some online influencers are even more influential than traditional celebrities.

Now, as for "web red", if you say this to foreigners, they can also understand it. This is a commonly used term by us Chinese, right? There is also the direct use of "Wang Hong". In short, all these terms refer to the same type of people. OK, now next one — let's take a look at the related vocabulary, such as "live streaming" and "live commerce". What are their corresponding English expressions?

For example, "live video stream" and "network broadcast" can both be used to express "网红直播" (online influencers' live streaming).

I think now, whether it's ordinary people, movie stars, teachers or experts, they are all doing live streaming.

No matter what their identity is, as long as they become famous online, we can call them "cewebrities".

We have learned the term "Key opinion leader" (KOL) before. There is also "发布视频", which can be said as "post a video"; "秒杀", its English expression can be "sec kill".

There are also "男主播" (male anchor) and "女主播" (female anchor); "关注" (follow); "取关" (unfollow); "打赏" (reward); "圈粉" (attract followers). "刷屏" (flow the screen); "点赞" (click the like or hit the like).

Alright, now that we know these vocabularies, let's move on to the next step — having a short dialogue.

Now, here's the question: Which cewebrity are you familiar with? Why you like him/her? What impact dohe/she has on China?
(Discussion omitted)

OK, time out. We will continue to talk about this question in the next class.Thank you for your attention.
